# Vibe Code Fresh Start

A simple starting point for building AI-powered projects. This template helps you plan and organize your project before diving into code, with integrated AI task management.

## What's This For?

This repository helps you:
- Plan your project properly before coding
- Keep your documentation organized
- Work efficiently with AI tools
- Automatically generate and manage tasks from your documentation
- Follow best practices from the start

## What's Included

### 📝 Documentation Templates
The `docs` folder contains templates to help you plan your project:
- Product Requirements - What are you building and why?
- User Requirements - Who will use it and how?
- Software Requirements - How should it be built?

### 🤖 AI Development Structure
Your project comes with organized AI assistance:
- Backend rules for server-side development
- Frontend rules for client-side development
- Specialized rules for specific tasks or frameworks
- Task management through [claude-task-master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)

## How to Use This Template

1. **Start with Planning**
   - Use the templates in `docs` to write down your project ideas
   - Take time to think through what you want to build
   - Plan out who will use it and how

2. **Document Your Requirements**
   - Complete the Product Requirements Document (what you're building)
   - Write the User Requirements Document (who will use it)
   - Create the Software Requirements Specification (how to build it)

3. **Set Up Your Project**
   - Initialize your project with your chosen tech stack
   - Set up your development environment
   - Configure any necessary dependencies
   - Organize your project structure

4. **Initialize Task Management**
   - Install claude-task-master: `npm install -g task-master-ai`
   - Initialize the task system: `task-master init`
   - Parse your requirements: `task-master parse-prd docs/01-product-requirements-document.md`
   - Review and organize generated tasks

5. **Begin Development**
   - Review the AI-generated tasks from your requirements
   - Use `task-master next` to see your next task
   - Work through tasks iteratively with AI assistance
   - Keep documentation and tasks updated as you progress
